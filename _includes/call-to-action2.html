                <p class="text-faded">Dedicated and ambitious for passionate professional and personal growth, Pau Sabater Nácher is an undergraduate student of two simultaneous Bachelor Degrees in the fields of Mathematics and Physics Engineering at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya under CFIS mentorizing. He was born in Algemesí, a small town in Valencia, Spain, until he received a residence grant for continuing his studies in Barcelona. Driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact, he has recently invested his time learning Machine Learning and Hardware Design, after being intern at an industry-leading start-up in California and a very recognized Institute of Technology in the metropolitan area of Barcelona. However, thanks to an active childhood, he needs to seamlessly weave calisthenics into his routine, rejoins his hometown's handball squad upon every homecoming, and rides the surging waves of the Mediterranean whenever its spirit awakens. He also relaxes by dancing fingers across both the violin's strings and the piano's keys, and he yearly travels with friends and family around the world to find out new cultures, experiences and perspectives.</p>
